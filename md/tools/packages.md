# Packages

**This section presents the different packages modified for Kaisen Linux and their function on the system.**

## Forked packages

###Â base-files
The base-files package will simply provide the following files on the system:

```bash
*/etc/kaisen_version
*/etc/issue
*/etc/issue.net
*/etc/os-release
```

These files are used to identify the system version in details, such as the system version number, distribution name, code name, etc.
These files are used by the live system during the welcome message on the system (here Debian has been replaced by Kaisen Linux).
They are also used to customize GRUB thanks to the lsb_release package which, in its default configuration will read the /etc/os-release file to find out the version of the OS.   

By consequently, personalize the GRUB entries in its default configuration by the command lsb_release -i -s (information present in /etc/default/grub at the line GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR) when executing the update-grub command. The goal here was to replace Debian with Kaisen on the GRUB entries of the installed system. This package surely has many other uses, but I have not encountered them so far.  

The package has therefore been recompiled to formalize the name of the distribution on the system and customize it a little more.

The file /etc/debian_version is replaced by the /etc/kaisen_version file in the Kaisen base-files package.

### linux
The kernel has been recompiled to generate .udeb files (used by the Debian installer) as well as .deb files needed to install it via apt or dpkg.  
The Kaisen Linux kernel has its own lean configuration.
The kernel is also recompiled to disable signing modules because signing modules breaks GRUB with Kaisen Linux configuration.

### debian-installer
This package is forked to build the installer with the custom Kaisen Linux kernel as well as our packages used by the installer (rootskel-gtk for example). It is necessary to rebuild the installer to integrate the modified packages for the installer and thus integrate them into the rolling release ISO.

### rootskel-gtk
This package has been modified because it provides the graphical configuration of the installer (theme, banners). The theme of the Kaisen Linux graphical installer is based on the original Clearlooks theme.

### apt-setup
This package allows you to configure the /etc/apt/sources.list file after installing the system.  
Since the Kaisen Linux installer is configured to request no network configuration, this package has been forked to add the Kaisen Linux repository, because by default, without internet connection (therefore no mirror selection), apt-setup will configure the Debian security repositories.  

### choose-mirror
This package configures the mirrors to be used to download packages.

### partman-auto
Forked to define BTRFS as default filesystem and reworked default schemes.

### debootstrap
This package builds and installs the base system (the packages mentioned as required). This package is forked to integrate the specific configurations of Kaisen Linux (build the base system from the distribution repository).

### desktop-base
This package provides wallpapers for the desktop, login screen, grub etc ...  
This package is forked to add the different Kaisen themes on the system to provide wallpapers as well as "alternatives" to define by default the theme to use. It is by default configured on kaisen-theme.  

### grub2
This package was forked to integrate the kaisen-grub-configuration package as a dependency. This allowed the possibility of providing a GRUB image even when the machine is encrypted and activating the plymouth theme.

### live-build
It is the official Debian tool for building system images. It was forked to add support for the "kaisen-rolling" repository.

### live-config
This package contains all live configurations. Forked to add components/0031-kaisen-password script. This script add a password for live system.

### shadow
This package was forked to use the /bin/bash shell by default when a user is created.  

### live-installer
Forked to add 61kaisen script to launch this script after the system installation.

### plymouth
Forked to define kaisen-theme by default for Plymouth.

### partman-btrfs
Forked to automatically create BTRFS subvolumes.

### simple-cdd
Forked to add kaisen profile. The kaisen profile add a custom preseed for NETINST ISO,
and add a postinst script to exec a few actions after the installation.

### debian-cd
Forked to adding kaisen-rolling repository

### tasksel
Forked to adding Kaisen Linux tasks

### lightdm-gtk-greeter
Forked to add Kaisen Linux lightdm settings

### net-retriever
Forked to add kaisen-archive-keyring-udeb package

### docker.io
Forked to add a conffile to change the default storage driver will be used by Docker

### virtualbox
Forked to add a conffile to load automatically vbox modules at boot

### virtualbox-ext-pack
Forked to change the default response provided by debconf

### virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
Forked to adapt the dependencies to the rest of the VirtualBox packages

### python-async-timeout
Forked to adapt the distributed version to the version required by GNS3

### netsniff-ng
Forked to replace ntpsec by chrony as recommended package

### timeshift
Forked to add few Kaisen specific patches

### spice-vdagent
Forked to fix the desktop launcher

### python-psutil
Cross-platform lib for process and system monitoring in Python

## Kaisen Linux packages

### kaisen-grub-configuration
The GRUB package has been recompiled to change the configuration of the /etc/default/grub file to add support for the default splash screen for the user on the installed system (graphical boot) and also allow in case the command lsb_release -i -s cannot be executed because the lsb-release script is not present, you can still display Kaisen and not Debian in the GRUB entries.  

The kaisen-grub-configuration package is installed automatically during system installation and automates this customization.

### kaisen-archive-keyring
This package provides the public GPG keys needed to use our secure repository with identity verification via a GPG key (used by official Debian repositories and implemented security by default).

### kaisen-menu
This package provides the custom menu. This includes the "skeleton" of the menu (allows you to organize the location of the different folders), the directories as well as the launchers of the applications. This menu is mainly used to reference the tools present in the distribution.

### kaisen-services-management
This package provides various bash scripts allowing you to easily manage additional services (added by software supplied with the distribution).  
The scripts are installed in `/usr/share/kaisen-services-management`. This package coupled with the "kaisen-menu" package allows you to reference and execute directly via the menu the scripts classified by service to activate or deactivate additional services. Two activation and deactivation scripts exist for all services.

### kaisen-update
This package just provides a script to perform an apt update && apt upgrade in one command. The kaisen-update command also allows to remove the most necessary packages (dependencies no longer used).

### kaisen-build
This package contains all configurations for build Kaisen Linux ISO.

### kaisen-interfaces

The package kaisen-interface-common package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command and commons packages for all interfaces.

### kaisen-skeleton
This allows you to have launchers on the desktop, the conky theme...  
This package replaces the old kaisen-*-default-profile packages which installed only the default profile of the related interface.
This package installs the kaisen-update-skel command.  

### kaisen-manpages
