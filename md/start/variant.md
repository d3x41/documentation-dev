This allows you to install directly an updated system and much lighter than what is provided by the various live systems. 
The configurator will allow you to customize your system post-installation and install more software. 
It starts automatically after the first boot of the system installed via the NETINST ISO and will ask you if you want to use the configurator or not. After your choice, the automatic launch of the configurator will disappear, and will remain installed if you wish. 
This ISO is reserved for an informed public and if you want to customize and have even more control over the distribution.
