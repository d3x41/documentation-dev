# Installation with NETINST ISO

## Prerequisites
Internet is mandatory for the installation via ISO netinst. Even if the system can be installed without internet, you will have a limited and certainly not fully functional installation.

##Â Modes
Graphical install: Graphical installer with mouse support.  
Install: Semi-graphic installer, comparable to a ncurses interface.    

In the **advanced options** menu:  

The **rescue mode** allows you to install the system in recovery mode in the event of a problem with an initial installation or in normal mode, he will suggest the use of a shell.You will usually never have to use it, but if necessary, it can surely help you and solve your problems.  

The **expert mode** will allow you to install your system and customize it even more than with normal mode. It will allow you for example to precisely choose the keyboard model that suits you, for example if you have a particular layout. It also allows you to select certain modules to load from the installation media. Be careful what you do, however. Forgetting an important module could compromise your installation and/or make it unstable.  

You will understand, it is a mode made to personalize its installation as well as possible, but can also be difficult to take in hand for a beginner. Use this mode only if you really know what you are doing.  
Note however that the preseed file and its configurations are taken into account in this mode.  

In the most classic cases, the normal mode will be more than enough.  

The **automated install** mode is not officially supported on Kaisen, it is present because it is provided by default by the installer but the automated installation is disabled.

## How the netinst installer works
The basic system will be installed after the internet has been configured.  
Then the tasksel software will be launched. This software will allow you to install a series of software of your choice in the form of a menu. This predefined set of proposed software are the packages and metapackages developed for Kaisen Linux.  

Here is this menu:  

4 graphic interfaces are currently proposed.
```
- MATE
- KDE
- XFCE
- LXQT
```
You must choose one of the 4. It is possible, but not recommended to install two or more simultaneously.  
If you want to change the GUI, you will have to use the kaisen-interface-switcher script.
