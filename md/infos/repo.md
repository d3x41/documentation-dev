This repository is the official Kaisen Linux repository. It is updated directly from the Debian testing repository continuously, the mirror is updated every 6 hours.  
It is the default repository contained in live images as well as on the installed system.

### kaisen-devel

It is a repository used for the development environment, it references developed/forks packages for distribution as well as integrated packages from another source such as Anydesk and TeamViewer for example.  
During rolling repository updates, all the packages in this repository are "pull" on kaisen-rolling to restore them after their removal due to the update of the repository.  
It is also used as stock when the updated packages are ready to go into production (kaisen-rolling).

### kaisen-packages

This repository simply stores forked/developed packages for Kaisen Linux. It is mainly used as a backup of kaisen-devel. It also serves as an environment for testing new versions of packages before pushing packages to kaisen-devel which will push these new packages to kaisen-rolling itself.
